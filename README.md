# Semantle from scratch

This is a remake of the popular word game [Semantle](https://semantle.com/). This project was built using the MERN stack. Word embeddings were trained using a [word2vec](https://github.com/danieloflynn/word2vec) model I created from scratch.

The goal of this project was to learn how to use the MERN stack.
